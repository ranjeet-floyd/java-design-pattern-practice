## The Factory Pattern 
[Ref Factory code ](https://github.com/ranjeet-floyd/java-design-pattern-practice/tree/master/src/main/java/com/self/design/pattern/factory)
    A factory pattern is one that returns an instance of one of several possible classes depending on the data provided to it. Usually all of the classes it returns have a common parent class and common method, but each of them performs a task differently and is optimized for different kinds of input.

### When to use Factory Pattern
    1.  A class can't anticipate which kind of class of objects it must create.
    2.  A class uses its subclass to specify which objects it creates.
